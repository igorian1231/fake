IMPORTANT DO NOT OPEN THE CAPSULE – it must be swallowed intact, to protect the bacteria from stomach acid Refrigeration:  Keep the microbiota in the refrigerator at all times, except to open the bottle and briefly remove dosage.  Take dose within 15 minutes of removing from refrigerator.  Do not expose to any heat. Keep Dry:  Keep all capsules in the container with the desiccant.  Seal the container tightly after each use. Avoid Heat:  If microbiota capsule is exposed to any heat above room temperature, or is left at room temperature for more than 60 minutes – CONTACT YOUR STUDY COORDINATOR Avoid placing microbiota capsules near hot spots (oven/stove/toaster, or leaving in hot cars), and keep refrigerated.  Even a brief dose of heat above room temperature may destroy the bacteria.  Request a replacement dose if there are any concerns. Call the study coordinator if you have any questions."
